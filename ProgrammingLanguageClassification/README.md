# Programming Language Classification with IBM Data Science Experience, Watson, and GitHub

## Description
In this Code Pattern, we will use a Jupyter Notebook on IBM Data Science Experience to build a predictive model that predicts a code's programming language based on its text. The model will then be evaluated against IBM's Watson Natural Languauge classifier.

When the reader has completed this Code Pattern, they will understand how to:

Build a labeled data set
Build a predictive model within a Jupyter Notebook
Configure and use Watson APIs
## Flow
1. The developer creates an IBM Data Science Experience Workspace.
2. IBM Data Science Experience depends on an Apache Spark service.
3. IBM Data Science Experience uses Cloud Object storage to manage your data.
4. This lab is built around a Jupyter Notebook, this is where the developer will gather data, train, and evaluate their model.
5. Create GitHub dataset.
6. Build Naive Bayes Classifier
7. Configure Watson Natural Language Understanding
8. Evaluate Models
